 - [ ] 1 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
 - [ ] 3 1/4 to 4 cups all purpose flour, plus more for dusting the work surface

## icing

- [ ] 1 cup confectioner's sugar, sifted to remove lumps
- [ ] 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- [ ] 1 pinch kosher salt

## filling
- [ ] 1 cup butter, melted
- [ ] 1 1/2 cups packed light brown sugar
- [ ] 6 tablespoons ground cinnamon
- [ ] 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt

# directions

outline:
 - make the dough
 - proof for 3-8 hours
 - make the filling
 - roll the dough and cut into cinnamon rolls
 - bake
 - let cool, ice

1. Heat the milk and butter in a small saucepan over medium low heat or in the microwave until the butter melts. Stir in the sugar and stir until dissolved. Remove the pan from the heat, set aside until the mixture has cooled to lukewarm - 100 to 115 degrees. It must be below 115. Don't proceed with the next step until the proper temperature is reached.

2. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook, mix together the yeast, potato flakes, eggs and egg yolks at low speed until well mixed. Add the warm milk mixture, and 1 1/2 cups of flour. Mix at medium speed until thoroughly blended, about 1 minute. Scrape down the bowl, and let rest for 10 minutes. Add the salt and 2 cups of flour. Knead at medium speed (adding more flour a tablespoon at a time if necessary) until the dough is smooth and freely clears the sides of the bowl, about 10 minutes. Flour your counter or board and shape the dough into a round, place it in a very lightly oiled large bowl, and cover the bowl with plastic wrap. Leave in a warm, draft-free spot until doubled in bulk, 3-8 hours. If your oven has a proof mode, this is a good time to use it! The longer it rises, the better.

3. When the dough is almost fully risen, mix up the filling. Melt the butter and stir in the brown sugar, cinnamon and salt.

4. After the dough has doubled in size, press it down and turn it out onto a lightly floured work surface (it does not take much flour). Using a rolling pin, roll the dough into a 16x12 inch rectangle, with the long side facing you. Use a ruler! Brush the filling mixture all over the dough, leaving a 1/2 inch border at the far edge. Roll the dough beginning with the long edge furthest from you, rolling it into a tight cylinder. Moisten the top border with water and seal the roll. Grease a 13x9 inch baking dish. Using unflavored, unwaxed dental floss, cut the roll into 12 equal pieces. Place the rolls, cut side up evenly in the prepared dish. Cover with plastic wrap and place in a warm, draft free spot until doubled in bulk, 1 1/2 to 2 hours.

5. When the rolls are almost fully risen, adjust an oven rack to middle position and heat the oven to 350 degrees. Bake the rolls until golden brown, 25 to 30 minutes. Remove the rolls from the pan and allow to cool on a wire rack.

6. When the rolls are cooling (at least 10 minutes), make the icing: Combine all of the icing ingredients in the bowl of a standing mixer and blend together at low speed until roughly combined, about 1 minute. Increase the speed to high and mix until the icing is uniformly smooth and free of cream cheese lumps, about 2 minutes. Spread the icing on the rolls with a rubber spatula. Serve warm!
