This Classic Tex-Mex Queso recipe is as good as you will find at your favorite Tex-Mex restaurant.  Creamy, silky, and with just enough heat to make it practically addictive.  Adjust the peppers and seasonings to your own tastes.  As written, this queso is close to medium heat. 
### Ingredients

*   2 tbsp unsalted butter
*   1/2 medium onion, chopped
*   2 fresh jalapeños, seeded and finely chopped (removing the seeds and ribs decreases the heat significantly)
*   3 cloves garlic, minced
*   1 tbsp pickled Serrano chiles (optional)
*   1 cup cherry tomatoes, halved
*   1 13 oz. can evaporated milk
*   2 tbsp corn starch
*   1 cup water
*   1/2 lb yellow American cheese, grated
*   1/2 lb white American cheese, grated
*   1 tsp ground cumin
*   1/4 tsp onion powder
*   1/4 tsp freshly ground black pepper
*   1/2 tsp Kosher salt
*   1 4.5 oz can green chiles
*   1 tbsp fresh cilantro, chopped
*   Pico de Gallo for garnish
*   Tortilla chips for dipping

### Instructions

*   Heat the butter in a large skillet over medium heat.
*   Add the onion, jalapeños and garlic and cook until softened, about 3 minutes.
*   Add the pickled Serrano peppers (if using) and tomatoes, and cook just until tomatoes begin to break down, about 3 more minutes.
*   In a medium bowl, add the corn starch to the evaporated milk, and whisk until dissolved and incorporated.  Whisk in the water and add to the veggies in the skillet.
*   Stir with a wooden spoon until just starting to thicken. 
*   Add in the cheese and stir until completely melted. 
*   Stir in the cumin, onion powder, pepper, salt, green chilies and cilantro.  Bring to just a simmer and let cook for a couple minutes.
*   Transfer to a warmed bowl, or small slow-cooker, and top with Fresh Pico de Gallo and warmed tortilla chips.
