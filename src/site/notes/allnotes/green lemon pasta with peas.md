based on cookie and kate recipe https://cookieandkate.com/lemony-kale-pasta-recipe/

# ingredients

- [ ] kale, with minimal stems, 24oz 
- [ ] extra virgin olive oil,  3/4 cup 
- [ ] garlic, smashed and peeled, 6 cloves
- [ ] 2+ medium lemons, zest and juice
- [ ] rigatoni pasta 1.5 lbs
- [ ] frozen peas 6 cups
- [ ] parmesan cheese, grated, 2.25 cups
- [ ] ricotta cheese, 1.5 cups
- [ ] salt, pepper, red pepper flakes

# directions

Boil kale for 8 minutes.

Meanwhile, heat olive oil in skillet over medium heat.  Either heat the full 3/4 cup EVOO, or exclude it and only use a tablespoon.  Cook garlic in oil until it is golden (if using all EVOO) or toasted (if not using all EVOO).  Transfer everything to blender.

Add to the blender most of the lemon zest, juice of 2 lemons, 1/4 teaspoon salt, red pepper flakes (to taste) and black pepper (to taste).  Use tongs to transfer cooked kale to blender (bringing some water along).  Save the remaining boiled kale water in its original pot.

Blend until smooth.  Add more kale water if it does not blend initially.  Adjust salt, lemon juice, and pepper to taste.

Add pasta to boiling kale water, and cook until al dente.  When done, save 1/2 cup of pasta water, then drain the pasta and return it to the pot.

Pour in green sauce, most of the parmesan, and peas.  Stir gently.

Serve garnished with a drop of ricotta, lemon zest, and a little olive oil.
