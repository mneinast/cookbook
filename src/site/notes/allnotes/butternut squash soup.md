# Ingredients
#ingredients 
- [ ] large butternut squash 2
	- halved vertically and seeds removed
- [ ] olive oil, 2 tbsp plus
- [ ] shallot, 2 large bulbs
	- chopped
- [ ] salt 2 tsp
- [ ] garlic cloves 8
	- minced
- [ ] maple syrup 2 tsp
- [ ] ground nutmeg 1/4 tsp
- [ ] black pepper
- [ ] vegetable broth, 6-8 cups
- [ ] butter 2-4 tbsp
- [ ] heavy cream 2-4 tbsp


# Directions
## roast the squash
Preheat oven to 425 F.

Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.  Place butternut squash on the pan inside-up, and lightly coat with olive oil and pinch of salt and pepper.

Turn the squash face down, roast until tender, about 40-50 minutes.  Cool enough to handle, about 10 minutes.

## prepare the flavor base
While squash bakes, saute chopped shallot over medium heat in a large soup pot, about 3-4 minutes. Add garlic and cook until fragrant.  Transfer contents to stand blender.

## blend soup
Scoop cooked squash flesh into blender. Discard skin.  Add maple syrup, nutmeg, black pepper, and vegetable broth (batches may be necessary). Blend until creamy.

Adjust thickness by adding soup to thin it out.  Add butter and/or heavy cream, salt, and pepper to taste.
