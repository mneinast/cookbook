#ingredients

- [ ] water 500g (80F, 27C)
- [ ] instant dried yeast 0.4g (scant 1/8 tsp)

- [ ] unbleached white flour 500g
- [ ] water 250g (105F, 41C)
- [ ] fine salt, not iodized, 21g
- [ ] instant dried yeast, 3g (3/4 tsp)
- [ ] poolish 1000g (all from above)

# Schedule

Mix poolish at 6 pm.

Mix dough at 8 am.
 - fold 20 minutes later

Divide and shape into loaves at 11 am.

Preheat oven + dutch oven at 11:15 am.

Bake at 12pm.

# Directions


## poolish
mix poolish in a large bowl.  Cover and leave overnight at room temperature (65-70F).

## dough
mix the final dough:
 - add flour, salt, and yeast to tub.
 - loosen the poolish from its container by pouring the warmed water around the edges.  Transfer the mixture into the tub.
 - Wet hands first, then mix the dough by hand.  Use the pincer method (page 67), alternating with folding.
 - final mix temperature should be 74-75F

fold dough 2-3 times.

## divide
When the dough is almost 3x its original volume, divide:
 - ease the dough onto lightly floured surface.
 - with floured hands, gently work dough into an even shape.
 - dust an area that will be cut in the center, dust a knife, then cut in half.

## proof and preheat
dust proofing baskets with flour.  Shape dough into medium-tight balls (see page 71-73).

Place seam side down in proofing basket.  Lightly flour the top, and cover with a towel.  Proof one hour, confirming proof with the finger-dent test (page 74).

Preheat dutch oven on the middle rack with the lid on to 475F.

## bake
Invert the proofed loaf onto a moderately floured surface. Add flour to the top, and depress the center of the loaf all the way to the surface with a 1-inch dowel.

Remove the dutch oven and its lid.  Carefully place the proofed loaf inside, keeping the same side up. Cover and bake 30 minutes.  Uncover and bake 20-30 more minutes, until medium dark brown all around the loaf.

## rest
Remove the dutch oven, and tilt out the baked bread.  Cool on a rack at least 20 minutes before serving.
