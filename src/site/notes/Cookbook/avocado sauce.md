# Ingredients
#ingredients 
* [ ]   2 ripe avocados
* [ ] Sour cream
* [ ]   The juice of 2-4 small limes adjust to taste
* [ ]   1 medium sized bunch of cilantro chopped
* [ ]   2-3 jalape√±os or Serrano peppers seeded and deveined (use green bell pepper for a non-spicy version)
* [ ]   3-4 garlic cloves crushed
* [ ]   1/4 cup olive oil
* [ ]   1 teaspoon ground cumin - optional adjust to taste
* [ ]   Salt to taste


# Directions

*   Combine all the ingredients in a blender; it helps the blending process if the avocados are in small chunks and the cilantro is lightly chopped. I also recommend crushing the garlic before putting it in the blender to ensure no one gets a surprise large piece of garlic.
*   Blend until you have a smooth sauce. Use immediately or refrigerate until ready to use.
